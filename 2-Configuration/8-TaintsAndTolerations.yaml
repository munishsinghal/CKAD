kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:<taint-effect>

taint-effect: NoSchedule | PreferNoSchedule | NoExecute
NoSchedule—The pod will not get scheduled to the node without a matching toleration.
NoExecute—This will immediately evict all the pods without the matching toleration from the node.
PerferNoSchedule—This is a softer version of NoSchedule where the controller will not try to schedule a pod with the tainted node. However, it is not a strict requirement.
