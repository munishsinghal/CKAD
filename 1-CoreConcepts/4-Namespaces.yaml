Que: What DNS name should the Blue application use to access the database db-service in the dev namespace? You can try it in the web application UI. Use port 6379.
Ans: Since the blue application and the db-service are in different namespaces. In this case, we need to use the service name along with the namespace to access the database. The FQDN (fully Qualified Domain Name) for the db-service in this example would be db-service.dev.svc.cluster.local.
