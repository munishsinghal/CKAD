The frontend-v2 deployment currently has 2 replicas. The frontend service now routes traffic to 7 pods in total ( 5 replicas on the frontend deployment and 2 replicas from frontend-v2 deployment).
Since the service distributes traffic to all pods equally, in this case, approximately 29% of the traffic will go to frontend-v2 deployment. To reduce this below 20%, scale down the pods on the v2 version to the minimum possible replicas = 1.
Run: kubectl scale deployment --replicas=1 frontend-v2
Once this is done, only ~17% of traffic should go to the v2 version.
